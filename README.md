## Gameplay

When a player starts the game, six randomly generated letters will appear in a bowl of alphabet soup and the one minute timer will start to count down. The player will type and enter a word using two to six of these letters. If the word is valid, new letters will replace the ones used. The word will be added to a list of found words and points will be added to the score depending on the length, with bonuses awarded for keeping a streak going. If the word is not valid, the same letters will return to the bowl. The player can choose to press the space bar to generate a new set of letters. When time is up, the player's final score and the top ten high scores will pop up. The player can then submit their name and score or play again.
