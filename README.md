# Alphabet-Soup

### Background

Alphabet-Soup is a word game where players try to spell as many words as they can in a minute using six random letters floating in a bowl of alphabet soup. Words will be checked against a dictionary for validity and awarded points based on length. As letters are successfully used, new letters will float to the surface. If the player spells an invalid word, the used letters will reappear in the bowl.

### Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:

- [ ] Start and reset the game
- [ ] Shuffle the letters or discard the letters (with a penalty)
- [ ] Keep track of their score
- [ ] View their final score and guessed words in an end game modal (that includes a restart button)
- [ ] View the game rules and a demo video in a modal

Additionally, this project will include:

- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

The game will be played on a single screen that holds the game view, game controls, links to LinkedIn/GitHub, and an instructions modal.

### Architecture & Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

I will also need a library of dictionary words with six or less letters.

### Implementation Timeline

Day 1: Setup the necessary modules and configure webpack. Build out the logic of the game and render a basic, playable view.

Day 2: Style the game view. Smooth out transitions and feedbacks.

Day 3: Style the modals and buttons.
